"""The single settings model, all env-driven.

Env vars carry deployment concerns (endpoints, keys, ports, knobs). Everything
client-specific (prompt content, names, the iteration cap) is NOT here — it arrives
per request as DIAL application properties (see `app_properties.py`).

When adding a parameter, pick its home by this test: varies per environment for the
same client → env field here; varies per client on the same infrastructure →
`ApplicationProperties`.
